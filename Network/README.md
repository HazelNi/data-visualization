# Network (Sigma)
This repo is created for the project [Environmental Defense Fund (EDF)/Columbia Center on Sustainable Investment(CCSI) Net-Zero Initiatives Network Graph](https://ccsi.columbia.edu/content/paris-aligned-financial-sector-initiatives). 
This repo contains codes to build the Sigma version of [Net-Zero Initiatives Network Graph](https://initiatives-netzero-ccsi.surge.sh/), which is exported from Gephi using Sigma.js Template, which generated codes for html, css, main.js, data.json, etc. 

###### Pros: 
- Is published and flexible embedding in websites
- Search bar function

###### Cons/Remaining Tasks:
- Improve the lag in transitions when the slider is dragged 
- Fix the bug (when click on a node, it shows all the nodes connected to it regardless their years of appearance)
- Edit titles in the info panel, taking out the irrelevant variables
- Changing node shape/color for milestones
- Add incremental months for all the initiatives in the same year so that they show up one by one

Important. The files must be uploaded to a webserver (or run one locally) in order to be viewed. JavaScript security prevents running the pages locally without a webserver.

The InteractiveVis project of the Oxford Internet Institute with funding by JISC aims to allow easy creation of interactive visualisations for geospatial and network data using native web technologies (HTML5, CSS3, and SVG) and allow these visualisations to be self-contained so that they may run entirely offline in ebooks and other media. The project will survey existing solutions and build the necessary components to fill in missing features and smooth over incompatibilities in between existing libraries. The project will further provide online hosted wizards to allow for the easy creation of these interactive visualizations.
